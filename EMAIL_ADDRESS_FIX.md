# 🔧 Email Address Issue - FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem:**
When you clicked "Send Test Notification", the email address was showing as blank in the console because the form data wasn't being saved to the notification service before testing.

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Auto-Save Before Test**
- Modified `handleTestNotification()` to save the current configuration first
- Now when you click "Send Test Notification", it automatically saves your email address

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added more detailed console logging to track email address
- You'll now see exactly what email address is being used

### 3. **Visual Confirmation**
- Added a green checkmark showing your email address below the input field
- You can now see that your email is properly saved

## 🧪 **Test It Now:**

1. **Go to Settings page**: http://localhost:3001/app/settings
2. **Enable email notifications** (toggle switch)
3. **Enter your email**: `okmisha06@gmail.com`
4. **You should see**: ✅ Email address: okmisha06@gmail.com
5. **Click "Send Test Notification"**
6. **Check console** (F12) - you should now see:
   - 📧 Email address: okmisha06@gmail.com
   - 📧 Email enabled: true

## 🎯 **What You'll See in Console:**

```
🧪 === TEST NOTIFICATION START ===
📋 Current config: {email: {enabled: true, address: "okmisha06@gmail.com"}, ...}
📧 Email enabled: true
📧 Email address: okmisha06@gmail.com
📧 Attempting to send email notification...
```

## 🚀 **The Fix:**

The test notification now:
1. **Saves your current settings** before testing
2. **Shows your email address** in the console
3. **Uses the correct email** for the test

**Try it now - your email address should no longer be blank!** 🐱✨
