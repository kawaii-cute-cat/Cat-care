# 🐙 GitHub Setup Guide for Your Cat Care App

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### 1. **Install Git (Required First)**
- Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Install with default settings
- Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation

### 2. **Configure Git with Your Credentials**
Open PowerShell and run these commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Misha Bablani"
git config --global user.email "okmisha06@gmail.com"
```

### 3. **Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cat-care-scheduler` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Cat Care Scheduler - React app for managing cat care routines"
4. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have files)
6. Click **Create repository**

### 4. **Connect Your Local Project to GitHub**
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your project folder:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Cat Care Scheduler with EmailJS, Dark Mode, and Photo Gallery"

# Connect to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cat-care-scheduler.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. **Authentication Options**

#### **Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give it a name: "Cat Care App"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **Generate token**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

#### **Option B: GitHub CLI (Alternative)**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

## 🔐 **Security Note:**
- Never share your GitHub password or personal access token
- Use Personal Access Tokens instead of passwords for Git operations
- Keep your tokens secure and don't commit them to code

## 🎯 **After Setup:**
Your project will be available at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cat-care-scheduler`

## 📝 **Future Updates:**
To push changes later:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
